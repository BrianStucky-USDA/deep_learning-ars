    "### MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Dataset\n",
    "The [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of a training set of 60,000 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9, and a test set of 10,000 images.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a widely used and deeply understood dataset and the images have been normalized and centered. The dataset is frequently used in machine learning research and has become a standard benchmark for image classification models. Top-performing models of deep neural networks can achieve a classification accuracy of above 99%, with an error rate between 0.4 %and 0.2% on the hold-out test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will perform a multi-classification by implementing a deep neural network(multi-layer). The goal is to classify images of handwritten digits into one of 10 classes.\n",
